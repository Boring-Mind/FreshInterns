                  Not getting internships is a big problem as internships serve
                  as an important signal that students are ready to work. In a
                  recent study students who had an internship on their CV
                  received 14% more offers for an interview than those who did
                  not. According to a research doing internships also leads to
                  higher wages than students who don’t have an internship.
                  <br /><br />
                  One of the worst parts of applying for internships is finding
                  out that you can't be considered for a certain application
                  based on your age. If you want to get an internship at a big
                  firm, it might be much harder if you are a sophomore or a
                  freshman. This is one frustration that can disappoint many
                  people when they look on the application page.

                  Another challenge young students face is that some internships
                  require a minimum GPA or area of study. These two problems
                  shut off a variety of students from applying and discourage
                  many from applying with scores that meet the requirements or
                  just miss them.
                  <br /><br />
                  At FreshIntern mentors would assign tasks that challenge the
                  intern, motivating him or her to work harder and value the
                  internship experience more. Employers can learn about a
                  potential employee’s work ethic, attention to detail, and
                  other qualities through an internship. They don't have this
                  knowledge about a candidate who has no prior work experience
                  in the company. Employees hired through after an internship in
                  the same company are also more loyal to the company, according
                  to a study conducted by the NACE in 2009.

                  Does this look familiar to you?
                  <br /><br />
                  Finding internships is tough. You spend countless hours each
                  week applying to internships, only to find your inbox filling
                  with rejections.
                  <br /><br />
                  Let’s say you land a couple of interviews.
                  <br /><br />
                  You prepare as best you can, make it past a few interviews but
                  then don’t get in. Or worse, you make it to the final round,
                  do well, and still don’t get the offer.
                  <br /><br />
                  Every few weeks you go through this process and end up with
                  the same outcome.
